# Project Introduction
## Traditional polling processes that are typically done over the phone or in-person are being replaced by methods that utilize information placed voluntarily and sporadically on the internet. Both methods require a supplementary bundle of features for optimal performance â€“ this project provides a model that can provide the necessary supplementary information. Results have demonstrated that a high performing ensemble of non-linear models trained on objective state-level metrics can predict U.S. federal senate elections with an F1 performance of above 90%. 
# Navigatating the GitHub
## Python code for this project is stored in the scripts folder. The scripts are numbered from 1-6 and were created and executed in that order. The first three download the data using webscraping and three different API's, the 4th and 5th utilize a local mysql server to perform EDA and prepare the final df, and the last python script contains the models. You can find the created visualizations in the visuals folder and the three excel files imported into MySQL in the final_MySQL_tables folder.
